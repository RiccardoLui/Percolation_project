# Percolation_project

Jupyter notebook containing simulations to reproduce the results of the paper [Flowing Sand: A Physical Realization of Directed Percolation](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.4999)
This was used as a final project for the course "Physics of Complex Systems" held by professor A. Trovato.

The notebook can be used to: 
- simulate a percolation model
- find the critical point
- study the critical exponents
